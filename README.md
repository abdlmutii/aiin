Aiin is a beta-level programming language that is currently being developed. This is a simple language that is easy to learn and understand, and is used to build simple scripts and command-line applications. The programming language uses simple English phrases to build programs.

## How to Install?
Before you start using Aiin, make sure that you have Node.js installed on your computer.

To install the Aiin package, you can run the following command:

```sh
npm install -g aiin
```

This will install the latest version of Aiin globally on your system.

## How to Use?
After installing Aiin, you can run .an or .aiin files by running:
```sh
aiin .
```
OR
```sh
aiin index.aiin/i.an
```
You can find examples of how to write Aiin programs in the [examples](https://github.com/abdlmutii/aiin/tree/main/examples) folder.

## Examples
Here is an example program written in Aiin:

```aiin
ask("What is your name", "input", "prompt")
  name = prompt
  log("Hello, {name}!")
```
This program asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting. When you run this program using Aiin, you should see output like the following:

```
? What is your name: Seif
Hello, Seif!
```
